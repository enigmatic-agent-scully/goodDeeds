# GoodDeeds

> Where good deeds meet real needs

## Description

This project was created with the MERN stack -- MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

This app aims to promote good deeds - direct, person-to-person acts of kindness, service, or financial assistance - for people in need. The idea began as a way to connect people in low-income neighborhoods with service providers who were willing to donate home repair services, but our group quickly saw its potential to match users with a much wider variety of personal and professional services.
