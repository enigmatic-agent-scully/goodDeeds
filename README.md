# GoodDeeds

## Where good deeds meet real needs

This app aims to promote good deeds - direct, person-to-person acts of kindness, service, or financial assistance - for people who live in low-income neighborhoods. The idea began as a way to connect people in low-income neighborhoods with service providers who were willing to donate home repair services, but our group quickly saw its potential to match users with a much wider variety of personal and professional services.

## Description

This project is a MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) app that allows an authenticated user to use the 'Get Help' page to create a post that includes the details of their need, which is then added to a list of the user's 'Unresolved Needs'.

Other users can view this post on the 'Give Help' page, which includes a list of all needs created by users other than themselves, as well as a map that pans to the location of the specific need that was clicked on the list.

Users can comment on and volunteer to help fulfill others' needs.

Once those needs are met, the need creator can mark it as 'Resolved' and it is moved to the 'Resolved Needs' list on the 'Get Help' page. Users can also edit their profile information after creating their account.
