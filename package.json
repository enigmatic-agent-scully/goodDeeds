  "description": "This app aims to promote good deeds - direct, person-to-person acts of kindness, service, or financial assistance - for people who live in low-income neighborhoods. The idea began as a way to connect people in low-income neighborhoods with service providers who were willing to donate home repair services, but our group quickly saw its potential to match users with a much wider variety of personal and professional services.",
